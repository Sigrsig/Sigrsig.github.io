					<p>Hi there! I'm Sigga, a Software Engineer from Iceland currently living in Berlin. I've recently finished my final year of computer science with the University of Iceland and am very excited to start getting some hands on experience in software development.</p>
					<p>During my time at university I've learned a wide variety of skills, but I've taken a special liking to UX design and web development. Currently I am focusing on gaining a better understanding of React, as well as learning more about UX design. </p>
					<p>In my free time I can be found busy in the kitchen or curling up with my cats, reading. I also have a huge interest in board games and pen and paper RPGs.</p>
